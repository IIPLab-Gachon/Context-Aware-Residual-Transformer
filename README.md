# Context-Aware Residual Transformer (CART)
Context-Aware Residual Transformer (CART) is a kiosk recommendation system (CART) that utilizes self-supervised learning techniques tailored to kiosks in an offline retail environment and developed by a collaboration between [NS Lab, CUK](https://nslab-cuk.github.io/) and [IIP Lab, Gachon](http://iiplab.gachon.ac.kr/)  based on pure [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) backend.

## 1. Overview

Over the years, Recommendation systems have been widely employed across diverse tasks to offer hyperpersonalized services considering usersâ€™ unique preferences and past behaviors. However, existing recommendation systems may be less suited for edge-computing settings because of their high computational costs and numerous parameters. In this work, we propose a novel kiosk recommendation system (CART) that involves (i) self-supervised learning based on contextual information in offline retail environments and (ii) representation learning of user behaviors based on contextual information. The proposed model uses self-supervised learning to learn user propensity, contextual information, and domain attributes from offline retail. We propose three selfsupervised learning tasks: (i) learning user propensity through transactions, (ii) learning domain characteristics through item purchases, and (iii) learning contextual information through user propensity and behavior. After pre-training with the three tasks, the proposed model was fine-tuned to focus on specific user behaviors based on contextual information. We also evaluated the quality of items recommended by the proposed kiosk recommendation system using the transactions of a real kiosk system. As a result, MAP@3 was improved by 29.1% compared to the existing recommendation system.

## 2. Reproducibility

### Datasets 

The package ```dataset``` contains our dataset for the experiments. The dataset contains transactions extracted from a kiosk company
database was used to evaluate the experiment.

### Requirements and Environment Setup

The source code developed in Python 3.9. CART are built using Pytorch_lightning. Please refers to official websites for installation and setup.
All the requirements are included in ```requirements.txt``` file. 

```
# Install python environment

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### How to run

The source code contains three files, i.e., pre_training, training, and testing files.

```
# Pre-training

python 0.pretrain.py

# Training CART with label

python 1.train.py

# Testing the performance

python 2.test.py
```
